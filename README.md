Users can choose one of two question categories: "Chatbot Development" or "Landing Pages Development." This allows users to ask questions and receive answers related to the chosen category.

## Questioning Process:
After selecting a category, the user receives a sequence of questions to answer. Each question is accompanied by a set of buttons, allowing the user to choose one of the provided answer options.

## Answer Storage:
User responses are stored in a MySQL database along with information about the response time, selected category, question, and the answer itself. This allows tracking and analyzing user responses for further use.

## Session Management:
The bot automatically manages user sessions, saving information about the current dialogue state and continuing to ask the next questions until the user completes the survey or interrupts the session independently.
